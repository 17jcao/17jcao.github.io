    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Joanna Cao.
    I am a senior at La Quinta High School. I am 17 years old.</p>
    <p>Since I am entering college soon, I'm looking forward to becoming more 
    independent and not having to stick to a tight schedule like I do
    in high school. My current goal is to major in computer science
    and then becoming an engineer once I finish college. However, before I 
    get a full-time job I'd like to go on a vacation with friends to 
    somewhere in Asia (maybe Japan, Taiwan, or Korea)! It would be great if
    I could study in broad in Korea but I don't find that likely.</p>
    <p>For fun, I enjoy listening to music, watching anime and kdramas,
    and hanging out with my friends. Being able to talk to my friend is 
    actually my favorite part about school!</p>

    <br>If you act as if 
    you're a know-it-all and will be making music you'll make your home
    go broke<br>From that point onwards, I didn't care no matter what 
    anyone said<br>I only lived how I wanted, guided by my own beliefs<br>
    In your eyes, how do you think I'm doing right now<br>
    How do you think I am?<br>I want to ask the several people who prayed
    for me to screw up<br>Does it seem like my home is going broke, you 
    bastards?"<br>-Min Yoongi (BTS)</p>
    <p style="padding-bottom:25px"><br>Hello! My name is Joanna Cao.
    I am a senior at La Quinta High School. I am 17 years old.<br><br>
    Since I am entering college soon, I'm looking forward to becoming more 
    independent and not having to stick to a tight schedule like I do
    in high school. My current goal is to major in computer science
    and then becoming an engineer once I finish college. However, before I 
    get a full-time job I'd like to go on a vacation with friends to 
    somewhere in Asia (maybe Japan, Taiwan, or Korea)! It would be great if
    I could study in broad in Korea but I don't find that likely.<br><br>
    For fun, I enjoy listening to music, watching anime and kdramas,
    and hanging out with my friends. Being able to talk to my friend is 
    actually my favorite part about school!</p>
